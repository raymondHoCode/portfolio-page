# portfolio-page
Welcome to my first coding project: the portfolio profile!  

I decided to work on a portfolio profile because it could be expanded upon when I build more projects over time. At the moment I am using the Odin project to learn about web development and decided it was a good opportunity to try my hand at creating a portfolio page with the use of basic html and css. In the process I have also learned the basics of Git and how to use the Ubuntu platform. In the future I am planning on adding transitions, a better design, and other fun functionalities to the webpage through javascript and it's frameworks.
