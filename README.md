# portfolio-page
Welcome to my first coding project: **My Personal Portfolio WEbsite**!  

I decided to work on a portfolio profile because it can be expanded upon as I build more projects over time. This project is a simple personal portfolio webpage built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  

As part of my learning journey with **The Odin Project**, I saw this as a great opportunity to practice web development basics while also getting hands-on experience with **Git**, **Linux** and **Ubuntu**.  

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding **JavaScript** functionalities, transitions, and improved design elements.
