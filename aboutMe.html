            <h1>About me: </h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Raymond! I'm currently a second year student at Wilfrid Laurier University
                pursuing a BBa in Business Administration & a BSc in Computer Science.
                I live my life always looking to learn or experience something new,
                whether it be a new programming language, a risk analysis platform or even music theory.
                With life having so much to offer it'll be a waste to not try something out right?
                Not only it's fun, in doing so I'm also able to gain a versatile set of perspectives and skills.
                All the greats were fantastic at their own sets of expertise whether it be aristotle and his proficiency
                in science, philosophy, and ethics or Benjamin Franklin's impressive ability in science, politics, and
                writing.
                Inspired by this, I'm striving to follow my own journey to become adept at my own subjects and
                contribute to the world in my own ways.

            </p>
