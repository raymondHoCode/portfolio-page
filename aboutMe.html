            <h1>About me: </h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Raymond! I'm currently a second year student at Wilfrid Laurier University
                pursuing a BBa in Business Administration && a BSc in Computer Science.
                I live my life always looking to learning or experiencing something new,
                whether it be a new programming language, a risk analysis platform or even music theory.
                With life having so much to offer it'll be a waste to not try something out right?
                In doing so too, I'm able to gain a versatile set of perspectives and skills, aligning with my
                belief that a diverse skillset can be more advantageous than specializing in just one area.


            </p>
